## Executive Summary

### North Star üåü
*An agentic AI platform for large tech enterprises to intelligently staff projects, accelerate onboarding, and build a real-time map of their engineering talent. Built for the FutureStack'25 Hackathon.*

### The Problem
In large product companies like Meta and Google, staffing critical projects is slow, onboarding new engineers takes weeks, and understanding the true skill set of a 10,000-person engineering org is nearly impossible. Skill data is often self-reported and quickly becomes stale.

### The Solution
North Star acts as an intelligent co-pilot for engineering leadership. It uses an agentic RAG system to analyze vast amounts of internal project data, providing data-driven insights and automating complex workflows.

### Core Features
- **Strategic Staffing (IntelliStaff):** Recommends the best-suited engineers for new projects by analyzing their proven, evidence-based skills.
- **Personalized Onboarding (Aurora):** Automatically generates custom learning plans by comparing a new project's codebase with prior work, slashing time-to-productivity.
- **Continuous Skill Intelligence (IntelliStaff):** Passively analyzes PRs submitted, reviews required, comments received, rereviews(churn rate) and jira ticket closed to build a dynamic, real-time "Talent Graph" of the organization's capabilities.

### How It Works
I built the platform on a secure, multi-tenant RAG architecture. A planning agent deconstructs requests, and an execution agent retrieves context from project-specific knowledge bases to inform its analysis and actions, such as creating Jira epics or Confluence pages.

## Platform Overview

### Capabilities
- FastAPI HTTP APIs for staffing, onboarding, retrieval, and audit flows.
- RQ-backed worker for GitHub/Jira ingestion and skill attribution.
- Policy enforcement, identity resolution, and agentic planner components.
- **Agentic layer:** Custom planner/executor with a centralized policy bus (RBAC), per-tenant isolation, and immutable audits. No LangChain. Intent is rule-based (regex allow-list); ambiguous requests fall back to read-only RAG. (Optional LLM-assisted intent is advisory only, behind RBAC + schema checks.)

### Personas
- **Platform Admin:** Configures policies, integrations, and reviews audits.
- **Project Lead:** Requests onboarding plans and checks staffing readiness.
- **Developer:** Consumes onboarding tasks and skill insights.

- Regenerate the full documentation bundle via `scripts/generate_arch_docs.py` to keep diagrams and indexes fresh.

### Backend Quickstart
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -e North-Star/Src/backend[dev]`
2. Provide `.env` values (see [Configuration Matrix](#configuration-matrix)).
3. Run API: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
4. Run worker: `python -m worker.main` when `QUEUE_MODE=redis`

### Glossary
- **Attribution Workflow:** Correlates PRs/issues to skill evidence.
- **Isolation Proof:** Policy proof package emitted for sensitive actions.
- **Planner/Executor:** Agentic orchestration for onboarding plan generation.
- **Retriever:** Vector search over Confluence/Jira content via Qdrant.

## Technical Deep Dive

### End-to-End Request Flow
- HTTP requests enter FastAPI routers (`app/routes/*`).
- Dependencies inject services (`app/services/*`) and policy guards (`app/policy/*`).
- Adapters (`app/adapters/*`) integrate with GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Qdrant, and LLM APIs.
- Persistence relies on SQLAlchemy models (`app/domain/models.py`) and Redis-backed queues.
- Worker handlers (`worker/handlers/*`) replay queued events for idempotent updates.
- Sequence references live under `Sequences/` for per-action breakdowns.

### Module Breakdown
- **Routes:** Request validation, rate limits, audit emission.
- **Services:** Domain operations for assignments, onboarding, retrieval, audits.
- **Policy:** Enforcement pipelines, deny lists, isolation proof emitters.
- **Agentic:** Planner/executor loop, skill extraction, tool registry.
- **Adapters:** Integrations across GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Qdrant, LLM providers.
- **Ports:** Interfaces consumed by services for substitution-friendly architecture.
- **Worker:** Job queue orchestrators and webhook processors.

### Agentic Orchestrator (No LangChain)

North Star uses a custom planner/executor instead of LangChain to guarantee multi-tenant RBAC, policy-gated tool use, and compliance-grade auditing.

**Why no LangChain?** I needed deterministic control over tool routing, tenant isolation, and audits. Those guarantees are easier with a minimal, explicit loop than a generic agent framework.

**What I built:**

- **Central policy bus:** every tool call goes through `policy_bus.enforce(tool, role)` (deny-by-default).
- **Tool registry at startup:** `register_all_tools()`, no dynamic exec.
- **Tenant isolation:** per-tenant Qdrant collections; ports re-check tenant on every read/write.
- **Immutable audits:** every ALLOW/DENY emits an audit record (zero side effects on DENY).

**Intent detection (current):** rule-based, not LLM.
- Regex triggers (e.g. `jira_epic`, `confluence_page`) + light parsing.
- Ambiguous phrases (e.g. "jira") fall back to read-only RAG.
- This is intentional hard-gating to prevent accidental writes.

**Example (intent ‚Üí gated tool):**
```python
# chat_orchestrator.py (simplified)
if _JIRA_TRIGGER.search(lowered):      # requires explicit 'jira_epic'
    tool = "jira_epic"; explicit = True
elif _CONFLUENCE_TRIGGER.search(lowered):
    tool = "confluence_page"; explicit = True
else:
    tool = None  # falls back to read-only RAG

# Planner will only execute registered tools after:
policy_bus.enforce(tool, user.role)    # deny-by-default
```

**Summary:** I run an allow-list, regex-gated, audited agentic loop with strict RBAC. No LangChain is used.

### Skill Graph Attribution
- GitHub webhooks (PRs, reviews, comments) resolve repository mappings and developer identity per tenant/project, triaging any unknown repo or user so events are never silently dropped.
- Each event appends evidence to an `AttributionWorkflow`; finalization is idempotent and gated on ‚ÄúPR merged‚Äù plus the linked Jira issue moving to a configurable done state.
- Once finalized, we upsert developer skill deltas (score, confidence, evidence reference, last-seen) via `worker.handlers.skill_extractor.apply_skill_delta`, ensuring the talent graph reflects the latest proof.
- Every finalize emits tenant-tagged metrics/logs for observability, making drift and throughput visible to ops teams.

### Policies & Identity
- RBAC and the policy bus reside in `app/policy/`.
- Identity resolution is handled in `app/services/identity_*`.
- `IntegrationEventLog` and `AttributionWorkflow` enforce idempotency and traceability.

### Persistence & Storage
- SQLAlchemy models cover tenants, users, projects, skills, attribution, audits (see ERD).
- Migrations (if present) live in `app/application/migrations`.
- Redis backs caching/queues; Qdrant stores embeddings; local FS hosts isolation proofs.

### Configuration Matrix

- Use `.env.local` to override secrets for test runs‚Äîautoloaded by the settings loader.

### Red-Team Tests & Enforcement ‚Äî Implementation Summary

1. **Tenant Isolation Negative Tests**  
	_Implementation:_ Cross-tenant retrieval and publish attempts return explicit policy errors, preventing data exfiltration.  
	_Files:_ `Src/backend/tests/test_security.py`; `app/policy/`

2. **Policy-Gated Tool Use**  
	_Implementation:_ Planner requests are denied unless the tool is whitelisted, with denials fully audited and side effects blocked.  
	_Files:_ `Src/backend/app/ports/planner.py`; `Src/backend/tests/test_planner_sanitization.py`

3. **Ingestion Replay Safety**  
	_Implementation:_ Duplicate and out-of-order webhook deliveries short-circuit safely via idempotency checks.  
	_Files:_ `Src/backend/app/application/ingestion_service.py`; `tests/test_github_webhook.py`; `tests/test_jira_webhook.py`

4. **RBAC Proofs**  
	_Implementation:_ Table-driven role checks ensure only authorized personas can reach each API surface.  
	_Files:_ `Src/backend/tests/test_security.py`; `app/policy/`

5. **Budget/Backpressure**  
	_Implementation:_ Per-tenant concurrency caps and request budgets defend against resource exhaustion during hostile load.  
	_Files:_ `app/services/`; worker/adapters (see scaling notes in this README)

6. **Traceability**  
	_Implementation:_ End-to-end traces link planner steps, adapters, and worker activity for audit replay.  
	_Files:_ `app/instrumentation/`; `app/domain/models.py::AuditLog`; `Src/backend/tests/test_planner_sanitization.py`

### Operations
- Deploy the API behind nginx (see `docker-compose.yml`).
- Worker binds to Redis queue `events`; ensure Redis is reachable for scaling out.
- Health endpoints exposed under `/health` and `/ready`.
- Scale API and worker horizontally as needed; share Postgres, Redis, Qdrant.
